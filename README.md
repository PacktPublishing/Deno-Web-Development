## Deno

Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with secure defaults and a great developer experience.

“Getting started with Deno” will introduce Deno’s primitives, its principles, and how developers can use it to build real-world applications. The book is divided into three main sections: introducing Deno, building an API from scratch, and testing and deploying a Deno application. The first chapters present the runtime and the motivations behind its creation. It explores some of the concepts introduced by Node, why many of them transitioned into Deno, and why new features were introduced. After getting comfortable with Deno and why it was created, the reader will start to experiment with Deno, exploring the toolchain, and writing simple scripts and CLI applications.
As we transition in the second section of the book, the reader will start with a very simple web application and will slowly add more features to it. This application will evolve from a simple "hello world" API to a web application connected to the database, with users, authentication, and a JavaScript client. In the meantime, topics like dependency management, configuration, testing, and application structure, among others will be addressed. 

By the end of the read, the reader is comfortable in using Deno to create, maintain, and deploy secure and reliable web applications.


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
const now = new Date();
console.log(`${now.getHours()}:${now.getMinutes()}:${now.getSeconds()}`);

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers who want to leverage their JavaScript and TypeScript skills in a secure, simple, and modern runtime, using Deno for web app development. Beginner-level knowledge of Node.js is recommended but not required
